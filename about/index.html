<p style="text-align: left">
I'm a 22 year-old Brit, born and raised in Hong Kong.<br/><br/>
A recent graduate of St Andrews, where I read Computer Science and Philosophy.<br/><br/>
My friends will probably tell you that I have an appalling sense of humour, a very low alcohol tolerance, and great taste in cars (or at least I think I do, regarding the latter).<br/><br/>
An introvert by nature, although less so than I used to be. When I think I tend to pace the room, and talk out loud to myself.<br/><br/>
I like to understand things when I take an interest in them and often do to a considerably deep degree. This applies to Machine Learning, a sub-field of AI, that I found out in the summer of 2017.<br/><br/>
I had done pretty poorly in the AI module at the end of my third year (in fairness most did, as it was poorly taught). But what bothered me was an overwhelming feeling of not having learned anything.<br/><br/>
As a consequence, I took it on myself to learn more about machine learning, which I was on vaguely passing terms at the time. I scoured the internet, did Andrew Ng's borderline-iconic Machine Learning course on Coursera, and eventually signed up for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree.<br/><br/>
That was my background when I started my dissertation in Computer Science, which was on using machine learning techniques to provide prognosis on colorectal cancer patients.<br/><br/>
I believe machine learning and the technologies that accelerate it have a lot of potential to do the kind of good I want to see in this world. So for the time being that'll be a major theme in my narrative. I suspect it will be for wider society as well, for quite some time.<br/><br/>
I'm greatly concerned about technology negatively impacting the labour market and gainful employment. I refuse to believe the narrative that the market will sort itself out - if you're curious I talk about this more in one of my blog posts. Consequently, I'm warming to the idea of some kind of 'automation tax', whereby individuals that are knowingly made redundant by automation are appropriately compensated by the companies/individuals that put them out of business.
